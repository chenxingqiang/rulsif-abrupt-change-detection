    "## 2.1. Abrupt change detection\n",
    "- ACD refers to algorithms that detect statistically significant changes in time series data. In this study, we used unconstrained least-squares importance fitting (uLSIF) method which has been known to detect changes more accurately than other detection methods (Liu, Yamada, Collier, & Sugiyama, 2013). uLSIF calculates a change point score using a density-ratio based dissimilarity measure from two consecutive time windows. The density-ratio based dissimilarity measure at time , is considered as the degree of difference between two consecutive time windows. It has a Pearson divergence (PE) form and is formulated as Eq. (1), in which all the variables can be learned from the data samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we use the data about speed, acceleration and yaw rate, the change point score increases whenever one or more density ratios of the three time-series data vary significantly. When the change point score exceeds the top 5th percentile, we detect this point as the change point. Once the change point is detected, we define the data of the corresponding time window (i.e., 15 s of speed, acceleration and yaw rate data) as a driving event.\n",

    "## 2.2. Sparse auto-encoder\n",
    "- Feature extraction process for the driving event is needed before clustering. Clustering is a method of grouping a set of data by collecting similar data for one group and separating the different data into other groups. As the raw driving records used as input to clustering are mostly large-scale, there are many data points only with subtle differences, which makes clustering difficult. In order to derive informative and interpretable clusters, therefore, those similar input data need to be regenerated into a generalized form; the results of this process are called features. In general, simple statistical values such as maximum, minimum, average and variance are used for feature values. However, these simple statistical values are not representative in many cases for capturing the features from time-series data. Thus, a sparse auto-encoder, a kind of neural network algorithm, is used for feature extraction in this study because it can provide a more generalized value and thereby extract new features that potentially outperform simple statistical values (Längkvist, Karlsson, & Loutfi, 2014).\n",
    "\n",
    "- The basic auto-encoder employs the specific concept of a neural network, in which output data replicate input data; this device consists of an encoder and a decoder, as shown in Fig. 1. The encoder is an abstraction process that makes input data belong to features; the decoder is an actualization process that causes features to reconstitute the original input data. The sparse auto-encoder is a version of a basic auto-encoder modified by adding a sparse term that enables the auto-encoder to extract more abstracted and generalized features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the input and output data, X and Z, the same set of in-vehicle sensor data recording speed, acceleration and yaw rate during event time periods were entered. The hidden representation, E, is determined by the encoder through a training process. This hidden representation includes values of driving record data abstracted during the events that were identified using ACD. Therefore, hidden representation is considered as a feature of the driving event and, using this, we are able to construct clusters using two-level clustering.\n",

    "## 2.3. Two-level clustering\n",
    "- The two-level clustering algorithm was used to classify the driving patterns. This is a sequential combination of two clustering algorithms: Self-organizing map (SOM) and K-means clustering. The first-level is SOM that distributes N inputs into M neurons with data similarity. The second-level is K-means clustering, which organizes M neurons into K number of clusters. This procedure reduces the dimensionality of the initial driving events from N to K, where N > M > K. Fig. 2 illustrates the concept of the two-level clustering algorithm. The benefits of using this algorithm are that it can reduce computational costs, and that it has noise robustness (Vesanto and Althniemi, 2000)."
